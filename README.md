# InfluxDB IOx

InfluxDB IOx (short for Iron Oxide, pronounced InfluxDB "eye-ox") is the future core of InfluxDB, an open source time series database.
The name is in homage to Rust, the language this project is written in.
It is built using [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and [DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/02/04/datafusion-donation/) among other things.
InfluxDB IOx aims to be:

* The future core of InfluxDB; supporting industry standard SQL, InfluxQL, and Flux
* An in-memory columnar store using object storage for persistence
* A fast analytic database for structured and semi-structured events (like logs and tracing data)
* A system for defining replication (synchronous, asynchronous, push and pull) and partitioning rules for InfluxDB time series data and tabular analytics data
* A system supporting real-time subscriptions
* A processor that can transform and do arbitrary computation on time series and event data as it arrives
* An analytic database built for data science, supporting Apache Arrow Flight for fast data transfer

Persistence is through Parquet files in object storage.
It is a design goal to support integration with other big data systems through object storage and Parquet specifically.

For more details on the motivation behind the project and some of our goals, read through the [InfluxDB IOx announcement blog post](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/announcing-influxdb-iox/).

## Project Status

This project is very early and in active development. It isn't yet ready for testing, which is why we're not producing builds or documentation yet. If you're interested in following along with the project, drop into our community Slack channel #influxdb_iox. You can find [links to join here](https://community.influxdata.com/).

We're also hosting monthly tech talks and community office hours on the project on the 2nd Wednesday of the month at 8:30 AM Pacific Time. The first [InfluxDB IOx Tech Talk is on December 9th and you can find details here](https://www.influxdata.com/community-showcase/influxdb-tech-talks/).

## Quick Start

To compile and run InfluxDB IOx from source, you'll need a Rust compiler and a `flatc` FlatBuffers
compiler.

### Cloning the Repository

Using `git`, check out the code by cloning this repository. If you use the `git` command line, this
looks like:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:influxdata/influxdb_iox.git
```

Then change into the directory containing the code:

```shell
cd influxdb_iox
```

The rest of the instructions assume you are in this directory.

### Installing Rust

The easiest way to install Rust is by using [`rustup`], a Rust version manager.
Follow the instructions on the `rustup` site for your operating system.

[`rustup`]: https://rustup.rs/

By default, `rustup` will install the latest stable verison of Rust. InfluxDB IOx is currently
using a nightly version of Rust to get performance benefits from the unstable `simd` feature. The
exact nightly version is specified in the `rust-toolchain` file. When you're in the directory
containing this repository's code, `rustup` will look in the `rust-toolchain` file and
automatically install and use the correct Rust version for you. Test this out with:

```shell
rustc --version
```

and you should see a nightly version of Rust!

### Installing `flatc`

InfluxDB IOx uses the [FlatBuffer] serialization format for its write-ahead log. The [`flatc`
compiler] reads the schema in `generated_types/wal.fbs` and generates the corresponding Rust code.

Install `flatc` >= 1.12.0 with one of these methods as appropriate to your operating system:

* Using a [Windows binary release]
* Using the [`flatbuffers` package for conda]
* Using the [`flatbuffers` package for Arch Linux]
* Using the [`flatbuffers` package for Homebrew]

Once you have installed the packages, you should be able to run:

```shell
flatc --version
```

and see the version displayed.

You won't have to run `flatc` directly; once it's available, Rust's Cargo build tool manages the
compilation process by calling `flatc` for you.

[FlatBuffer]: https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/
[`flatc` compiler]: https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_using_schema_compiler.html
[Windows binary release]: https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases
[`flatbuffers` package for conda]: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/flatbuffers
[`flatbuffers` package for Arch Linux]: https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/x86_64/flatbuffers/
[`flatbuffers` package for Homebrew]: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/flatbuffers.rb

### Specifying Configuration

**OPTIONAL:** There are a number of configuration variables you can choose to customize by
specifying values for environment variables in a `.env` file. To get an example file to start from,
run:

```shell
cp docs/env.example .env
```

then edit the newly-created `.env` file.

For development purposes, the most relevant environment variables are the `INFLUXDB_IOX_DB_DIR` and
`TEST_INFLUXDB_IOX_DB_DIR` variables that configure where files are stored on disk. The default
values are shown in the comments in the example file; to change them, uncomment the relevant lines
and change the values to the directories in which you'd like to store the files instead:

```shell
INFLUXDB_IOX_DB_DIR=/some/place/else
TEST_INFLUXDB_IOX_DB_DIR=/another/place
```

### Compiling and Starting the Server

InfluxDB IOx is built using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build tool.

To compile for development, run:

```shell
cargo build
```

which will create a binary in `target/debug` that you can run with:

```shell
./target/debug/influxdb_iox
```

You can compile and run with one command by using:

```shell
cargo run
```

When compiling for performance testing, build in release mode by using:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

which will create the corresponding binary in `target/release`:

```shell
./target/release/influxdb_iox
```

Similarly, you can do this in one step with:

```shell
cargo run --release
```

The server will, by default, start an HTTP API server on port `8080` and a gRPC server on port
`8082`.

### Writing and Reading Data

Data can be stored in InfluxDB IOx by sending it in [line protocol] format to the `/api/v2/write`
endpoint. Data is stored by organization and bucket names. Here's an example using [`curl`] with
the organization name `company` and the bucket name `sensors` that will send the data in the
`tests/fixtures/lineproto/metrics.lp` file in this repository, assuming that you're running the
server on the default port:

```shell
curl -v "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v2/write?org=company&bucket=sensors" --data-binary @tests/fixtures/lineproto/metrics.lp
```

[line protocol]: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/line-protocol/
[`curl`]: https://curl.se/

To query stored data, use the `/api/v2/read` endpoint with a SQL query. This example will return
all data in the `company` organization's `sensors` bucket for the `processes` measurement:

```shell
curl -v -G -d 'org=company' -d 'bucket=sensors' --data-urlencode 'sql_query=select * from processes' "http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v2/read"
```

## Contributing

InfluxData very much welcomes contributions from the community!
To make the process easier and more valuable for everyone involved we have a few rules and guidelines to follow.

Anyone with a Github account is free to file issues on the project.
However, if you want to contribute documentation or code then you will need to sign InfluxData's Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which can be found with more information [on our website].

### Submitting Issues and Feature Requests

Before you file an [issue], please search existing issues in case the same or similar issues have already been filed.
If you find an existing open ticket covering your issue then please avoid adding "üëç" or "me too" comments; Github notifications can cause a lot of noise for the project maintainers who triage the back-log.
However, if you have a new piece of information for an existing ticket and you think it may help the investigation or resolution, then please do add it as a comment!
You can signal to the team that you're experiencing an existing issue with one of Github's emoji reactions (these are a good way to add "weight" to an issue from a prioritisation perspective).

#### Submitting an Issue

The [New Issue] page has templates for both bug reports and feature requests.
Please fill one of them out!
The issue templates provide details on what information we will find useful to help us fix an issue.
In short though, the more information you can provide us about your environment and what behaviour you're seeing, the easier we can fix the issue.
If you can push a PR with test cases that trigger a defect or bug, even better!
P.S, if you have never written a bug report before, or if you want to brush up on your bug reporting skills, we recommend reading Simon Tatham's essay [How to Report Bugs Effectively].

As well as bug reports we also welcome feature requests (there is a dedicated issue template for these).
Typically, the maintainers will periodically review community feature requests and make decisions about if we want to add them.
For features we don't plan to support we will close the feature request ticket (so, again, please check closed tickets for feature requests before submitting them).

### Contributing Changes

InfluxDB IOx is written mostly in idiomatic Rust‚Äîplease see the [Style Guide] for more details.
All code must adhere to the `rustfmt` format, and pass all of the `clippy` checks we run in CI (there are more details further down this README).

[Style Guide]: docs/style_guide.md

#### Finding Issues To Work On

The [good first issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/labels/good%20first%20issue) and the [help wanted](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/labels/help%20wanted) labels are used to identify issues where we encourage community contributions.
They both indicate issues for which we would welcome independent community contributions, but the former indicates a sub-set of these that are especially good for first-time contributors.
If you want some clarifications or guidance for working on one of these issues, or you simply want to let others know that you're working on one, please leave a comment on the ticket.

[good first issue]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/labels/good%20first%20issue
[help wanted]: https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb_iox/labels/help%20wanted

#### Bigger Changes

If you're planning to submit significant changes, which don't relates to existing community tickets **please** talk to the project maintainers first!
The easiest way to do this is to open up a new ticket, describing the changes you plan to make.
Example of changes where we would encourage up-front communication:

* new IOx features;
* significant refactors that move code between modules/crates etc;
* performance improvements involving new concurrency patterns or the use of `unsafe` code;
* API-breaking changes, or changes that require a data migration;
* any changes that risk the durability or correctness of data.

We are always excited to have community involvement but we can't accept everything.
To avoid having your hard work rejected the best approach to start a discussion first.
Further, please don't expect us to accept significant changes without new test coverage, and/or in the case of performance changes benchmarks that show the improvements.

#### Making a PR

To open a PR you will need to have a Github account.
Fork the `influxdb_iox` repo and work on a branch on your fork.
When you have completed your changes make a Pull Request to InfluxDB IOx [here].

Before you submit a PR you should verify the following locally:

* you have a coherent set of logical commits, with messages conforming to the [Conventional Commits] specification;
* all the tests and/or benchmarks pass, including documentation tests;
* the code is correctly formatted and all `clippy` checks pass; and
* you haven't left any "code cruft" (commented out code blocks etc).

There are some tips on verifying the above in the [next section](#running-tests).

**After** submitting a PR, you should:

* verify that all CI status checks pass and the PR is üíö;
* ask for help on the PR if any of the status checks are üî¥, and you don't know why;
* wait patiently for one of the team to review your PR, which could take a few days.

### Running Tests

The `cargo` build tool runs tests as well. Run:

```shell
cargo test --workspace
```

### Running `rustfmt` and `clippy`

CI will check the code formatting with [`rustfmt`] and Rust best practices with [`clippy`].

To automatically format your code according to `rustfmt` style, first make sure `rustfmt` is installed using `rustup`:

```shell
rustup component add rustfmt
```

Then, whenever you make a change and want to reformat, run:

```shell
cargo fmt --all
```

Similarly with `clippy`, install with:

```shell
rustup component add clippy
```

And run with:

```shell
cargo clippy  --all-targets --workspace
```
